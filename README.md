# UniversalPad
A notepad app with a twist.

On UniversalPad I have implemented AES 256-bit encryption, Load, Save, Reset Password, Reset Keys. 
I wrote this for myself and my wife liked it enough to say, 'why dont you show it to other people, maybe they might buy it?'. So, I'm let the app out of the bag, so to speak. I plan on adding a lot more to it and then selling it for a modest price. With that being said, I give permission for people to download, build and use for their own <b>PERSONAL USE</b>. Please do NOT modify and sell it. I worked long hours to learn all of this and put it together...your respect of that is greatly appreciated.
